This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Tetris game implementation. The project appears to be in its initial setup phase.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, common development commands will be established as the project grows. Typical Tetris game implementations may include:

- Game engine/framework setup (HTML5 Canvas, React, or game engines)
- Game state management (grid, pieces, scoring)
- Input handling (keyboard controls)
- Game logic (piece rotation, line clearing, collision detection)

## Architecture Considerations

For a Tetris implementation, key architectural components typically include:

- **Game State**: Managing the playing field grid, current piece, next piece, score, level
- **Piece System**: Tetromino definitions, rotation logic, movement validation
- **Game Loop**: Rendering, input processing, game state updates
- **Collision Detection**: Piece-to-grid and piece-to-piece collision checking
- **Line Clearing**: Detection and removal of completed lines

## File Organization

As the project develops, consider organizing code into logical modules for maintainability and testing.
